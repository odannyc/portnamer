# portnamer
A bot that can tell you what service is on what port. Gamified!

## Slack
There's a couple things you can ask `portnamer`:

1. hi, hello
2. help
3. quiz me
4. give me a random port
5. whats on port 22?
6. what port does telnet use?

You can ask be as brief as `22` or `telnet` and it'll answer you back.

The quiz will endlessly ask you questions until you say `quit`. It asks you stuff like `What service uses port 22?`
